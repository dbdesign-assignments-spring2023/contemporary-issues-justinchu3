# Data in the Metaverse
In this document, I discuss two articles with opposing views on how and what data should be used in the rise of the metaverse. 

## Article 1
In Forbes's [The Role Of Data In The Metaverse](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/01/30/the-role-of-data-in-the-metaverse/?sh=b6927b57792f), the author discusses the integral role of data in the metaverse, which refers to virtual environments that mimic real life and allow for human-like interactions. As the metaverse grows due to advancements in technology and the increasing use of virtual reality and augmented reality, data will be used to create more immersive and personalized experiences for users. 

The article states that one of the key elements of the metaverse is to create realistic avatars to represent ourselves. For example, we will likely see AI technology being used to analyze 2D user images or 3D scans to create realistic and accurate avatars. Personally, I understand why the metaverse relies on "good data", meaning data with integrity - after all, the goal is to make the metaverse realistic. If we fake our data in the metaverse, then interactions become less genuine and the entire experience becomes less life-like. The beauty of using data with integrity is to mimic the real world inside a virtual world. Then, people can be free from physical and geographical restraints to interact with friends, family, colleagues and even strangers in a meaningful and real manner.

## Article 2
However, CNBC's [The metaverse may bring new cyber risks. Hereâ€™s what companies can do](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/23/the-metaverse-may-bring-new-cyber-risks-heres-what-firms-can-do.html) highlights the potential cyber risks associated with the growth of the metaverse and virtual environments. It discusses the new opportunities for cybercrime and hacking that arise with the rise of the metaverse and the importance of companies preparing for these risks through strong security measures and education.

I believe the rapid growth of the metaverse presents both exciting opportunities and important challenges, especially with regards to data privacy and security. As technology continues to advance, it is crucial that companies take the necessary steps to protect users and their data in the virtual environment, and that regulations are in place to hold companies accountable. While "good" data should be the foundation of the metaverse, it is important for users to educate themselves on the potential risks and to take steps to protect their personal and financial information in the metaverse. Naturally, companies that invest in the metaverse need to invest in protecting user data as well.
